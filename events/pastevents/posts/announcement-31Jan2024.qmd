#### Announcement:

Dear Colleagues,

First of all we wish you an happy new year!
We are very pleased to announce that a new version of PFIM, version 6.0, is available on CRAN since November 2023.

Download :

* From the Comprehensive R Archive Network: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PFIM/index.html){.external target="_blank"}
* From the Github repository: [GIT](https://github.com/iame-researchCenter/PFIM){.external target="_blank"}

PFIM is an R package for population designs evaluation and optimization, based on the expression of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) in nonlinear mixed effects models. This new version 6.0 is the result of a complete refactoring of the previous version PFIM 5.0 using the formal object oriented system S4.

This new version offers users a completely new and simple usage script to facilitate design evaluation and optimization.  There are examples on our Github repository and two vignettes on CRAN.

We hope that you will appreciate and use this new version, and the PFIM group is available to answer to any question <thepfimgroup@googlegroups.com>.

Best wishes

Romain Leroux, Lucie Fayette, Jeremy Seurat, France Mentr√©, for the PFIM group
