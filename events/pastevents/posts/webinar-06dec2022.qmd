This informative webinar presented on Tuesday, December 6 at 10 am EST (4:00 PM CET) was sponsored by SxP SIG.

Our esteemed speakers helped pharmacometricians understand two important statistical concepts: estimands and causal inference. Oliver Sander presented a common understanding of what is exactly to be estimated, to strengthen the dialogue between disciplines, and to ensure that the estimand addresses the scientific question of interest. Christian Bartels provided a brief introduction to causal inference and focus on positioning modeling and simulation as an approach to obtain causal estimates in pharmacometrics.
