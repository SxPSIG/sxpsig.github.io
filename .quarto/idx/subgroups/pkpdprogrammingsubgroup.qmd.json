It is to promote discussions related to the handling of data and supportive programming for Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) or Pharmacometric analysis. We welcome contributions of contents on programming tips, best practices, and standardization across industry and academics.\\\n\n### Objectives\n\n-   Establish a community for pharmacometric and pharmacokinetic programmers across industry and academics\\\n\n-   Collect and share best practices, challenges and examples for programmers to support pharmacometric and PK analysis\\\n\n    -   Organize 2-3 open to public sessions in a year\\\n    -   Discussion board -- Discussions on popular topics like data standards and best practices\\\n    -   PKPD Programming Library- Materials on regulatory submission guidelines, best practices, training, recordings for past open to public sessions etc.\\\n    -   Identifying topics for presentation at conferences\\\n\n-   Collect and share best practices, ideas, challenges and examples for programmers to support pharmacometric and PK analysis\\\n\n-   Share ideas of training new PK/PD programmers (standard curriculum)\\\n\n### In Scope\n\n-   NCA datasets\n\n-   Population PK and exposure-response analysis datasets\n\n-   TFLs for reporting\n\n-   CDISC standards (including ADPC, ADPP, ADPPK)\n\n-   E-submission\n\n-   Quality control\\\n\n### Out of Scope\n\n- Conducting NCA and pharmacometric analysis\\\n\n### Membership\n\n-   Membership in the Interest Group is open to anyone interested in establishing collaborations between statisticians and pharmacometricians.
