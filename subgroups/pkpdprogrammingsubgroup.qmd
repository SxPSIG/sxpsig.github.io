The PK/PD Programmer Forum is a sub-team under the Statistics and Pharmacometrics Interest Group (SxP). It is to promote discussions related to the handling of data and supportive programming for Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) or Pharmacometric analysis. We welcome contributions of contents on programming tips, best practices, and standardization across industry and academics.

### Objectives

• Establish a community for pharmacometric and pharmacokinetic programmers across industry and academics

• Collect and share best practices, ideas, challenges and examples for programmers to support pharmacometric and PK analysis

• Share ideas of training new PK/PD programmers (standard curriculum)

### In Scope

• Programming to support NCA and pharmacometric analysis

• NCA datasets

• Population PK and exposure-response datasets

• TFLs for reporting

• CDISC standards (including ADPC and ADPP)

• E-submission

• Simulation

• Quality control

### Out of Scope

• Conducting NCA and pharmacometric analysis
